# Bejeweled-M5stickc
Bejeweled game implemented for the ESP32 M5StickC controller. The game features a dynamic grid-based board filled with colored gems that players can swap to create match-3 sequences. It supports cascading matches, multiple levels with varying dimensions and gem colors, score tracking, move limits, and persistent save/load functionality using the device's flash memory. The implementation includes a graphical interface on the M5StickC display with intuitive controls via buttons and tilting, allowing players to navigate, select gems, and manage the game state. Designed with memory optimization in mind, the system ensures smooth gameplay while providing flexibility for level progression and future feature expansions.
